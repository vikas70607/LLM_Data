Once upon a time. King Krishnadev Rai was sitting in court in Vijayanagar. At the same time a beautiful woman came to the court with a box.

There was a velvet saree in that box, which she took out and started showing to the king and all the courtiers in the court. The saree was so beautiful that whoever saw it would be astonished.

The woman told the king that she makes such beautiful sarees. She has some artisans who weave this saree with their secret arts. She requested the king that if he gave her some money, she would make a similar saree for him too.

King Krishnadev Rai agreed to the woman's request and gave her money. The woman asked for one year's time to prepare the saree. After this, the woman started living in the king's palace with her saree weavers and started weaving sarees.

During this period, the palace itself bore all the expenses of that woman and the artisans including food and drink. Similarly one year passed. Then the king sent his ministers to the woman to see the saree. When the minister went to the artisan, he was surprised to see. There two artisans were weaving something without any thread or cloth.

The woman told that her artisans were weaving sarees for the king, but the ministers told that they could not see any sarees. On this the woman said that only those people can see this saree, who have a clean mind and have not committed any sin in their life.


Hearing this from the woman, the king's ministers became upset. He made an excuse and told the woman that he had seen the saree and left from there. Coming back to the king he said that the saree was very beautiful.

The king was very happy with this. The next day he ordered the woman to appear in the court with the saree. The woman came to the court the next day with her artisans carrying a box. She opened the box in the court and started showing the saree to everyone.

Everyone sitting in the court was very surprised, because none of the courtiers including the king could see any saree. Seeing this, Tenali Ram whispered in the king's ear that the woman had lied. She is fooling everyone.

After this, Tenali Ram told the woman that he or any courtier sitting in the court could not see this saree.


Hearing this from Tenali Ram, the woman said that this saree will be visible only to the one whose mind is clean and has not committed any sin.

Hearing this from the woman, a plan came to Tenali Ram's mind. He said to the woman – “The king wants you to come to the court wearing that saree yourself and show that saree to everyone.”

Hearing this from Tenali Ram, the woman started apologizing in front of the king. She told the king the truth that she had not made any saree. She was fooling everyone.

The king became very angry after listening to the woman. They sentenced her to prison, but when the woman pleaded, they forgave her and let her go. The king also praised Tenali Ram's cleverness.

Moral of the story – Lies or deception cannot be hidden for long. One day or the other the truth comes out in front of everyone.
